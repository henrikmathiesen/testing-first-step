/*

	We specified our test function inline here
	There is currently no good way to get to source code functions
	from revealing module pattern. We need to find a better system.
	
	UPDATE
	
	Jasmine, Karma and Karma Browsers with Gulp
	
	- Jasmine is a framework for running tests
		* It can work with javascript files through the require system
		* It has however no access to the web browser and a web applications referenced javascript files
		
	- Karma is a framework for running tests, such as jasmine tests, in a browser environment
		* It has a built in web server
		* We specify what browser to use, what testing framework to use and which files to include in the test (tests and their dependecies) in karma.conf.js
		* We run the tests with Gulp
